                to get stronger,<br>leading to often more intensive training</p>

                                generation to generation in the Kuina family.

                <li>Before joining the Straw Hat Pirates, 
                    Zoro worked as a bounty hunter. 
                </li>
                
                <li>Zoro has a prominent scar over his left eye,
                    which he received from his own actions during 
                    his training with his mentor, Dracule Mihawk. 
                </li>
                
                <li>Zoro is infamous for having an incredibly poor sense 
                    of direction. He frequently gets lost, leading to 
                    humorous situations where the crew must find him.
                </li>
                
                <li>In the anime, Zoro often delivers dramatic and inspiring 
                    lines, known as "eyecatcher lines," that reflect his 
                    determination and warrior spirit.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Zoro is recognizable by his distinctive green hair and
                    his signature white bandana, which he often wears tied 
                    around his left bicep.
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    Zoro is portrayed as a serious and focused individual. 
                    He often provides a strong, pragmatic voice within the crew. 
                </li>

                <li>Another fun fact: He's my favorite
                    character in the entire show!
                </li>
            </ul>
